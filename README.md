# For web support

Follow these 2 website to make your current flutter project to support flutter web
1. https://medium.com/flutter-community/flutter-create-and-deploy-a-website-from-scratch-4a026ebd6c
2. https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/web

# Getting Started

1. Change the name of the folder
2. Change the git remote url with your current repo url `git remote set-url origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git`
3. run `flutter channel master` in terminal -> change to channel master to best support
4. run `flutter pub get` in terminal -> get the packages defined in pubspec.yaml class
5. run `flutter clean` in terminal -> clean the flutter project
6. Change Information Android -> change `package`, `android:label` from `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` -> then change `applicationId` from `android/app/build.gradle` -> search file of `MainActivity.kt` or `MainActivity.java`, then change the package value to desired package name -> change file path of `MainActivity.kt` or `MainActivity.java`, example is like this `android\app\src\main\kotlin\id\ndonproject\agenparkir`
7. For iOS change it from info.plist file located in `ios/Runner/info.plist`
7. Change app icon -> set url of the icon you want to use in pubspec.yaml file, then run `flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main`

# Basic packages used

1. mobx for state management
2. get_it for dependency injection
3. http & dio for http request, http package use for optionally call request that doesnt support serialize with dio
4. flutter_html for support html tag (load http tag string)
5. flutter_masked_text for masked the textfield
6. shimmer for create shimmer loading like facebook
7. connectivity for check the device connection
8. shared_preferences for save local data
9. etc

# Networking schema

1. Create class for response model, example in `success.dart`
2. Register model class that we wrote before to `base_service.dart` so we can easily parse the json with class model (look at the fromJson method in `base_service.dart`) 
3. Create class service (example in `user_service.dart`) for call the http method writen in `base_service.dart`
4. Create method in `user_service.dart` for example you can look doLogin method, in there we pass `success.dart` class to the generics class to, which mean we want the result of the http request to that class model.
5. Call `user_service.dart` class anywhere you want to do http request, in the example we call it in `base_stores.dart`, because we use mobx for state management wen can place the http transaction in the stores class so it can be modular.

# Add new model(http response model) or stores(mobx class for event and state management)

1. Create model class, look example of `success.dart`
2. Create stores class, look example of `base_stores.dart`
3. run in terminal `flutter pub run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs`
4. .g.dart file will generated automatically after proccess in terminal done
